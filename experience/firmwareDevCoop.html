			From January - December of 2020, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to work at <b><a href="https://www.avigilon.com/" target="_blank">Avigilon</a></b> under my dream position as a Firmware Developer. These 3 coop terms were significantly beneficial to me as they really helped me gain a lot of technical as well as other soft skill knowledge. I got to help the senior developers to bring up the 
			<b><a href="https://www.avigilon.com/products/cameras-sensors/h4-thermal-etd" target="_blank">H4 Thermal Elevated Temperature Detection</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.avigilon.com/products/cameras-sensors/h5-pro" target="_blank">H5 Pro</a></b> camera lines.

			<p class="collapse" id="details">
				My daily tasks as a Firmware Developer Coop were to assist senior developers on board bringups; implement new features on new firmware releases; contribute towards code base maintenence; debug issues, escalations and assist other teams on running unit tests, setting up prototypes or researching.
				<br>
				During the 12 months at Avigilon, I gained a lot of experiences as well as crucial knowledge for my future career as Firmware Developer. I got to work with <b>C++</b> on a daily basis so I was able to understand its' syntax and components a lot better. Also, I always strived towards understanding and utilizing the most out of the C++ libraries in order to modernize my code. Furthermore, by following the company coding standards, I was able to build up better habits of maintaining my code starting from the very little things such as variable naming. Apart from that, I also got to strengthen my <b>Python, Javascript</b> knowledge.
				<br>
				Apart from the technical skills, I was able to strengthen my communication and teamwork skills as well. Being able to collaborate with the teams under the Scrum environment provided me a new perspective of teamwork which really helped me work/communicate so much more efficiently.
