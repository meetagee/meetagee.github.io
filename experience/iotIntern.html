			During Summer of 2019, I asked for an internship at the <b>Internet of Things (IOT) Department at FPT Telecom, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</b> so that I could strengthen my Computer Engineering experience more. I got assigned to work with an instructor who helped me understanding more about embedded systems, object-oriented C/C++ programming and various real life applications/prototypes that the company had to offer such as Home Security Systems, Smartwatches, etc.

				During the whole time, I was lucky to have the chance to get my hands on using their frameworks and prototype boards. Technically speaking, I got the chance to improve a lot on my memory management skills through various Heap/Memory pool implementation tasks and using Event-driven architecture in C Programming. Moreover, I got to design my very first 2 embedded games <b><a href="http://tunglam2101.github.io/techProjs/breaker.html" target="_blank">Breaker</a></b> and <b><a href="http://tunglam2101.github.io/techProjs/flynshoot.html" target="_blank">Fly N' Shoot</a></b>. Furthermore, I improved a lot on my soldering skills when I got the chance to solder various microcontroller units (MCUs), integrated circuits (ICs) on prototype printed circuit boards (PCB).
