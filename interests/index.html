					<p>
						Algorithms and data structures are not only crucial for my learning and career but also a part of my interests.</p>
					
						<p class="collapse" id="algDetails">
							As a Computer Engineering student, I am always fascinated by the variety of algorithms and their improvement in terms of space and time complexity.
							<br> When I am free, I sometimes read about applications and their related algorithms. <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank">Leetcode</a> was a particular source for this interest of mine. The real life applications/interview questions provided there are not only helpful for my job-seeking process but also helps me a lot to improve my coding skills.

					<h3>Embedded Systems & Applications</h3>
					<p>
						Embedded Systems are another field of interest of mine due to their portability, low-cost and most importantly, their variety in real-life applications.

						<p class="collapse" id="embDetails">
							I have been recently working a lot with embedded systems, MCUs such as ATmega328P, STM32 and low-level object-oriented <b>C/C++</b>. I found these systems extremely powerful, sustainable and portable. They consume low power and have lots of possibility for crucial real-life applications. I have actually seen various applications such as Home Security Systems, Smartwatches which are fascinating.
							<br> Also, the software comes along with embedded systems tend to be low-level and so, it really fits my purposes and brings me a challenge to become a better Computer Engineer in the future.

					<h3 style="color:White">Mechanical Keyboards</h3>
					<p>
						I like Mechanical Keyboards very much. Their clicky sound and hearing just makes me feel great, especially when I have to type a lot for my code. Also, the idea of being able to customize your own keyboards via different switches, layouts, keycaps is particularly interesting to me!
						
						<p class="collapse" id="mechKbDetails">
							I have tried most of the Cherry MX switches and am currently owning a <b>Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro S</b> and an <b>Anne Pro 2</b>. I would love to build a 60% Mechanical Keyboards soon in the future!

					<h3>Gaming</h3>
					<p> 
						I play online games quite frequently. I love the intensity, teamwork and skills that games require one to effectively perform.

						<p class="collapse" id="esportsDetails">
							Furthermore, I admire the work of all the games that I play, from their game logic designs, the cosmetics, etc.
							<br>Currently, I am playing quite a lot of <b>Dota 2</b> and <b>Path of Exile</b>.

					<p> 
						I love music. I listen to music almost whenever I do anything. I pretty much listen to all kinds of music as long as it fits my mood or sounds interesting to me. I also love singing and playing instruments despite being not very good at those.

						<p class="collapse" id="musicDetails">
							Quick fact:</b> I can play guitar, piano and a bit of drums. I was also a part of a singing club and have performed for various ceremonies during high school.

					<h3>Bodybuilding & Weight Training</h3>
					<p>
						Despite having to spend hours and hours sitting to study and work, I also take care of my physical health through bodybuilding and weight training. I love working out and watching its' progressive results on my health and body. It is also a way for me to relax after stressful hours of learning.
