			<b>The Art of Compression</b> was a school project (or assignment, I would say) that a colleague and I did during Spring of 2019 while I was in an Computer Science Algorithms and Data Structures course. The project's objective was to create a <b>C++</b> application that can manipulate images' pixels and their RGB values to create stunning mosaic-like effect.</p>
		
			<p class="collapse" id="aocDetails">
				Through the project, I learned a lot more about using/writing classes and recursive functions. Since we had to make use of our understanding about Trees, recursion came in very handy. Moreover, I leanred about using pointers and managing memory more efficiently.
				<br> For this project, we coded in <b>C++</b> using a provided pixels manipulation library called <b>HSLAPixel</b>.
