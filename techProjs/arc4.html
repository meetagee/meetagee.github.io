			<b>ARC4 Decryption </b> was a school project (or assignment, I would say) I did during the Summer of 2019 while I was in a Digital Systems Design course. During this time, I was learning about FPGAs and this project was an application on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4" target="_blank">ARC4</a> (which is a popular symmetric stream cipher, and was widely used in encrypting web traffic, wireless data) Decryption circuit.</p>
		
			<p class="collapse" id="arc4Details">
				Through this project, I learned a lot about coding in SystemVerilog and cleared many confusions related to Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and programming languages, where the modules in HDLs run concurrently compared to the traditional sequential approaches. I was also very amazed by the power of FPGAs and how they can be the future's widely used technology where projects can be prototyped easily and quickly using only code.
				<br> For the hardware component, I used a <a href="https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=836" target="_blank">DE1-SoC development kit</a> running on <b>ARM Cortex-A9</b>.
				<br> For software, I coded the circuit and testbenches in <b>SystemVerilog</b> under the <b>Ready-enable (Handshaking) Protocol</b>. The code was simulated and synthesized using <b>Modelsim</b> and <b>Quartus Prime Lite 17.1</b>
