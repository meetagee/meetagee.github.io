			<b>(Brick) Breaker</b> was a personal project I did during the Summer of 2019. Since I was learning about embedded systems, I thought I could recreate a game which I really enjoyed when I was a kid called Breakout. The game's objective is basically to clear all the bricks available and gain score.</p>
		
			<p class="collapse" id="breakerDetails">
				Through the project, I learned a lot about embedded systems and object-oriented C programming. Since the game contains a lot of objects, I had to define a lot of <code>struct</code> and manage them efficiently. Moreover, I got to understand a lot more clearer about Finite State Machine (FSM), which is a core concept of the underlying running logic of the whole project. Memory utilization and algorithms were also things that I leanred from the project. I had to design tasks and states along with proper algorithms to minimize the running time of each task so that the game would not go into fatal crashses - which of course, make my game a lot more unstable.
				<br> For the hardware component, I used a development kit running on <b>TM32L (ARM Cortex-M3) MCU.</b>
				<br> For software, I coded the game in <b>C/C++</b> using a framework written by my instructor called <b>Active Kernel</b>. The game also runs in an Event-driven architecture.
