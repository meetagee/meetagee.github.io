			<b>Graphs, Networks and Games</b> was one of the first programs that I have ever written in the past 2 years of my Computer Engineering academic life. It is a school project (or assignment, I would say) done by me and a colleague while we were in a Software Construction course. The project basically implements graphs (Adjacency List and Adjacency Matrix) along with searching algorithms (Breadth First Search and Depth First Search) and rely on those to implement a small game called <b>Boggle</b> with a provided simple Java GUI.</p>
		
			<p class="collapse" id="graphDetails">
				Through the project, I learned a lot about Graphs, its' related algorithms, applications in real life and Interfaces in Java. The most challenging part about this project was that we had to modify our searching algorithms a bit differently since the game was expanded to wrap around the board. Moreover, the board could become very big and so running time was a huge problem to us. It even took us nearly 15 minutes to find all the possible combinations of words in the game. However, the project was really enjoyable and valuable for me as a starter in programming by that time.
				<br> We coded the game in <b>Java</b> using provided interfaces and GUI for the game.
