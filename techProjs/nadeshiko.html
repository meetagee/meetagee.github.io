			<b>Nadeshiko</b> was a personal project that I did during 2019 Winter break. It is basically a Discord bot built in <b>Python</b> using the <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#" target="_blank">discord.py</a> library.

			<p class="collapse" id="nadeshikoDetails">
				This was a pair programming project that I did with a close friend of mind. He also wanted to learn more programming languages so I thought Python was a great starter language here.
				<br> A bit background on the name Nadeshiko. I took the name from the character <a href="https://yuru-camp.fandom.com/wiki/Nadeshiko_Kagamihara" target="_blank">Nadeshiko Kagamihara</a> (yes, I know what you're thinking - this guy is a weeb :)). But she is caring and adorable - basically the characteristics of an ideal assistant for one. Anyway...) after finishing a very cozy anime series called <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34798/Yuru_Camp%E2%96%B3" target="_blank">Yuru Campâ–³</a>. 
				<br> The motive for me to make it is because I use Discord very often for chatting with my friends, not only while playing video games but studying as well. Sometimes we even have study groups via Discord and so I thought - why not making a bot that plays music and helps you doing Wolfram Alpha queries for your math homework? 
				<br> We only had a 2-week winter break to work on it before a busy term began so it is faily simple. Though, the bot is able to find/query/play music from Youtube via keywords/links. Moreover, it can do Wolfram Alpha query and make some meme-related materials just so you can make fun of your friends... I worked mainly on the music player. It was fairly tricky even though I found tons of tutorials/examples online. However, they were kinda outdated and so I had to dig in into it. Though, fun project it was!
