			<b>Nixie Clock</b> was a personal project that I made during 2019 Winter break. I have always been a fan of it and wanted to build one myself using my knowledge with <b>Arduino, C</b> and <b>C++</b>.</p>

				I have always been a fan of nixie clocks, especially when I finished the 2 seasons of <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins_Gate" target="_blank">Steins;Gate</a>, where it is called the <a href="https://steins-gate.fandom.com/wiki/Divergence_Meter" target="_blank">Divergence Meter</a>.
				<br> I started the project during summer of 2019. Unfortunately, one of the components (Nixie driver IC - SN74141) that I bought went horribly broken so the clock was not functioning correctly and it was about the time I fly back to Canada for my study. Luckily, with a bit of my dad's help in getting the new PCBs as well as the components, I was able to finish and brag about it.
				<br> The nixie clock was fully built based on an <a href="https://doayee.co.uk/nixie/" target="_blank">open source project</a> that I found online. It was built with 6 IN-12A bulbs (with some really cool RGB backlight) driven by HV5122 ICs. All I needed to do were soldering the components, loading the Arduino example, understanding what the driver code was doing and finally integrating the RTC and so it turned into a real clock.
				<br> Details can be found on Doayee's Github repository (once again, all the credits goes to this awesome guy for such an awesome open source project): <code><a href="https://https://github.com/doayee/Nixie" target="_blank">https://github.com/doayee/Nixie</a></code>
