			<b>Osu! Keypad</b> was a personal project that I made when I was eager to have a low-cost keypad that can serve the purpose of playing the game <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/home" target="_blank"><b>Osu!</b></a> (which is a rhythm-based game that I really enjoy playing).

			<p class="collapse" id="osuKeypadDetails">
				I looked up online and found an instruction that was available that did not seem to cost me too much. Moreover, the owner of the instruction shared his PCB design and code so it was not much of a hassle for me to build it. The switches that are currently soldered are Cherry MX Black. I am planning on making another one with Cherry MX Red to test if it improves any performance on my Osu!-playing skills.
				<br> For this project, I used an Arduino Pro Micro and Arduino IDE to upload all the code into it. Worked fine! Although, there was a problem with the PCB where the third switch from the left was not wired to TXO (according to the schematics) so I had to solder a jumper wire to connect them.
