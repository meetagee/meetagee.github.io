			<b>Mobile Vault</b> was a group project that 5 more colleagues and I were working on during the Computer Engineering Design Studio course. Our mission was to integrate all that we had learned so far on Python, Raspberry Pi and sensors to create a small-scaled application. My roles in the project were developing the Frontened and verifying the integration of hardware (sensors, etc.) and software (Python).

			<p class="collapse" id="vaultDetails">
				Our idea was to make a portable safe (or a security system) that can be controlled/monitored via a webpage. The <b>Mobile Vault</b>'s functionalities consist of real-time image capture of its' front door, alarm system and a passcode-controlled locking system.
				<br> Through the project, I learned a lot about Frontend developing since I was the main Frontend developer of the project. I got to design our webpage and deal with interfacing/sending/receiving data from our Backend. I also learned about Backend developing in <b>Python</b> and <b>Django</b>. Even though we did not apply various concepts of <b>Django</b> into our project such as <b>Memcache</b>, I also read about it a lot and perhaps can come in handy when it comes to another similar project. For the hardware components, we used a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B along with various componenets such as camera, motion detector, piezo buzzer, LCD, keypad, etc.</b>
				<br> For software, we coded in <b>Python</b> and <b>JavaScript, HTML</b> using <b>Bootstrap 4, Ajax</b> for Frontend Development and <b>Django</b> for Backend Development (in which we stored our data in simple <code>.txt</code> and <code>.jpg</code> files).
				<br> Further details, including a Fritzing file of the design can be found on my Github repository: <code><a href="https://github.com/meetagee/mobile-vault" target="_blank">https://github.com/meetagee/mobile-vault</a></code>
